\section{AREA OF PROJECT}
\hspace*{0.3in}\textbf{E-learning Application}:E-learning is a computer based educational tool or system that enables you to learn anywhere and at any time. Today e-learning is mostly delivered though the internet, although in the past it was delivered using a blend of computer-based methods like CD-ROM. Technology has  advanced so much that the geographical gap is bridged with the use of tools that make you feel as if you are inside the classroom. E-learning offers the ability to share material in all kinds of formats such as videos, slideshows, word documents and PDFs. Conducting webinars (live online classes) and communicating with professors via chat and message forums is also an option available to users. With the right tool various processes can be automated such as the marking of tests or the creation of engaging content. E-learning provides the learners with the ability to fit learning around their lifestyles, effectively allowing even the busiest person to further a career and gain new qualifications. Overall, traditional learning is expensive, takes a long time and the results can vary. E-learning offers an alternative that is faster, cheaper and potentially better.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\newpage
\section{PROJECT IDEA}
\hspace*{0.3in}  In proposed system we present the secure , reliable and stable online E learning based application The subject input and questions , difficulty level will given as input from user Respected data will be stored on backend which is cloud . On backend admin will be manage tests releated database work While user uses android aplication , admin wil use website Admin will able t classify user based on their performance manage for analysis Mannually written API is used for handling data
\\
 
\section{MOTIVATION}
\hspace*{0.3in}E-Learning is great. It’s cost-effective, time-efficient and ideal for delivering standardised training to huge groups of learners spanning even greater geographical areas. However, it does not come without its challenges. One of the key issues with E-Learning lies in its struggle to retain, engage and motivate learners. At some point in our education, we’ve all sat in a classroom or lecture hall, tuned out the voice of our teacher and let our thoughts drift off to other things. Many traditional classroom trainers find it difficult to recognise when students are there in person but not in mind.\\
\hspace*{0.3in}With online learning, however, the difference is often much clearer. Learners who are not engaged or enthusiastic can be recognised easily because they simply close their browser and fail to complete their learning. A key worry faced by many E-Learning practitioners is whether or not E-Learners will be motivated enough to complete their programmes and have a greater understanding at the end.
\\
we  produce digital learning that is easy on the eye and attention-grabbing.\\

\nextpage
\section{LITERATURE SURVEY}
\hspace*{0.3in}Many applications have been developed that provide E-learning Facility.
\\
\\
1. Duolingo- Duolingo provides written lessons and dictation, with speaking
practice for more advanced users.Each lesson includes a variety of speaking,
listening, translation, and multiple choice challenges.Instantly see which answers
user get correct. When user miss a challenge, this will quickly show user
how to improve.Duolingo track users by recording how many days in a row
user spend learning a language. Duolingo is an app that allows user to practice
pronunciation but not to speak from day 1.There is no human interaction.
Limitation-There is no dynamacity provide as per users request.
\\
\\
2. Project Euler- Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer
programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights
to solve.It is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar
areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context. Limitation-
It does not track users progress.
\\
\\
3. Cetiq- this app provide the questions on physics, chemistry, biology,maths(PCMB)
subject.It is just use for preparing the CET exam.CETIQ also provide leaderboard
where usercan see how many questions you solve skipped and answered.
Limitations- it just filter the questions based on subject.their is no daynamicity
for solving the test.

\section{MAJOR CONSTRAINTS}
\hspace*{0.3in}The system will not work if internet is disabled.\\

\section{METHODOLOGIES OF PROBLEM SOLVING AND EFFICIENCY ISSUES}
\hspace*{0.3in}The system consists of following stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Requirement Analysis:} Requirements analysis is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These features, called requirements, must be quantifiable, relevant and detailed .  The requirements should be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system desiged .
\\
\item \textbf{Designing and developement:} At this stage, there are
many php platforms available in market like laravel , cake PHP , Qphp,codeigniter
from which we selected codeiginter  for development of site as it is 
easy to learn and also it have many features . It has MVC Model .   
The site is designed using bootstrap and W3.css . The tutorial application is developed in android . 

\item \textbf{Performance Analysis and Evaluation}At this stage, the execution
times and optimal response time of application is analyse by solving
test using different android device.

\end{enumerate}

\section{OUTCOMES}
\hspace*{0.3in}Tutorial requested by student.\\

\hspace*{0.3in}\textbf{Back end:} Mysql,PHP 5.2,Javascript,JQuery\\
\newpage
\item \textbf{Operating System:}\\
\\
\hspace*{0.3in}\textbf{Android:}Android is a mobile operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel and currently developed by Google. With a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touch screen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear).\\
\hspace*{0.3in}The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. Despite being primarily designed for touch screen input, it has also been used in game consoles, digital cameras, regular PCs, and other electronics.\\


\item \textbf{Tools:}\\
\hspace*{0.3in}\textbf{CodeIgniter Framework:}CodeIgniter  is an application  development framework, which can be used to develop websites, using PHP.  It is an Open Source framework.  It has a very rich set of functionality, which will increase the speed of website development work. CodeIgniter  will make task easier.  It has a very rich set of libraries and helpers.  By using CodeIgniter,  saves a lot of time,  Not only that,  a website built  in CodeIgniter  is secure  too,  as it  has  the  ability  to  prevent various attacks  that  take place through  websites.
\\

\item \textbf{Programming Language:}\\
\\
\hspace*{0.3in}\textbf{PHP:}The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications.\\
\hspace*{0.3in}PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase,Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.\\

\chapter{PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION}
\newpage
\section{INTRODUCTION}
This document describes both the test plan and the test procedure along with goals and objectives of test specifications.\\

\section{Goals and Objectives}
The objective of our test plan is to find and report as many bugs as possible to improve the integrity of the system. Although exhaustive testing is not possible, a broad range of tests is exercised to achieve the goal of bug free and accurate results in software.\\

\section{TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED}
\begin{itemize}
\item Filezilla\\
FileZilla is a free software, cross-platform FTP application, consisting of FileZilla Client and FileZilla Server. Client binaries are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, server binaries are available for Windows only. The client supports FTP, SFTP and FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS).\\
FileZilla's source code is hosted on SourceForge and the project was featured as Project of the Month in November 2003.[3] However, there have been criticisms that SourceForge bundles malicious software with the application; and that FileZilla stores users' FTP passwords insecurely.
\item Sublime Text\\
Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.
Sublime Text is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.
\item Postman
A Little About Postman. Postman is a Google Chrome app for interacting with HTTP APIs. It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses

\chapter{SOFTWARE TESTING}
\newpage
\section{Statement of Scope}
The software testing is to be done for all components in every module of software.The results of the modules must be compared with actual known values to test the correctness of the procedure.\\
\\
\textbf{Introduction:}Software testing is the process of executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3.5 cm,width=10 cm]{testing.png}
\caption{Basic Testing Mechanism}
\end{figure}
\section{TEST PLAN}
\hspace*{0.3in}This section describes the overall testing strategy and the dissertation management issues that are required to properly execute effective tests.
\subsection{Testing Strategy}
The overall strategy for software testing is described here.
\subsection{Unit Testing}
\hspace*{0.3in}Each module is tested separately.The criterion selected for unit test modules are identity modules that have core functionality implemented and its execution is independent of other modules.\subsection{Integration Testing}
\hspace*{0.3in}In integration testing, the modules which are unit tested are combined and testing is performed to see if the correct information is passed between the modules as per the algorithms..
\subsection{Static and Dynamic Analysis}
\hspace*{0.3in}Static analysis involves going through the code in order to find out any possible defect in the code. Dynamic analysis involves executing the code and analysing the output.
\subsection{GUI Testing}
\hspace*{0.3in}The user interface is tested to check the functionality of all the scenes, buttons and navigation components.
\subsection{White Box Testing}
\hspace*{0.3in}White box testing strategy deals with the internal logic and structure of the code. White box testing is also called as glass, structure, open box or clean box testing.
\subsection{Black Box Testing}
\hspace*{0.3in}Black Box Testing is testing without knowledge if internal working of the item being tested. For Example when black box testing is applied to software engineering, the tester would only know the legal input and what the excepted output should be, but not how the program actually arrive at those output.
\subsection{Test Schedule}
The work products gives correct flow of the system and produced its intended function.
\subsection{Test Case}
\hspace*{0.3in}A test case in software engineering is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether an application or software system is working correctly or not.\\

\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE}
\newpage
\hspace*{0.3in}
In this project, we have presented a Android Based E-Learning Application .We implement the  system through an application on Android platform. And to illustrate the effectiveness of the system, we develop admin site  using Codigniter.\\
 We also conduct several experiments to evaluate our application.  The experimental
results show that our developed system can work effectively on android devices.  Friendly user interface is very  important  for  an  application.   Most  of  people  decide  whether  to  use an application only by its user interface.  Thus, we use bootstrap and w3.css to design admin site .\\
proposed system is developed which is accessible at any time as long as
the user brings the mobile devices and internet connection is available.
System is developed using bootstrap for the mobile device in which it is
supported with javascript and CSS as its basic display that can be used
for further needs.

\hspace*{0.3in}It should include assignments such as\\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item
Use of divide and conquer strategies to exploit distributed/parallel/concurrent
processing of the above to identify object, morphisms, overloading in
functions (if any), and functional relations and any other dependencies
(as per requirements). It can include Venn diagram, state diagram, function
relations, i/o relations; use this to derive objects, morphism, overloading
\item
Use of above to draw functional dependency graphs and relevant Software
modeling methods, techniques including UML diagrams or other
necessities using appropriate tools.
\item
Testing of project problem statement using generated test data (using
mathematical models, GUI, Function testing principles, if any) selection
and appropriate use of testing tools, testing of UML diagram’s reliability.
Write also test cases [Black box testing] for each identified functions. You can use Mathematica or equivalent open source tool for
generating test data.

\textbf{Testing of Project Problem Statement}\\

\textbf{Introduction:} Software testing is the process of executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors. Or it involves any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of the system and determining that it meets its required results. Software is unlike other physical processes where inputs are received and outputs are produced. Where software differs is in that manner in which it fails. Most physical systems fail in a ﬁxed set of ways. By contrast, software can fail in bizarre ways. Detecting all of the different failure modes for software is generally infeasible.\\

\hspace*{0.3 in}Testing is performed for following purposes:\\ 
\hspace*{0.3 in}1. To improve quality\\
\hspace*{0.3 in}2. Veriﬁcation and validation Basic software testing \\
